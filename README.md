    <h1>Giovani Florek - Software Developer</h1>
    <p><strong>About Myself:</strong> I live in Brazil and have over 5 years of experience as a software developer. I graduated in Technologies in Systems Analysis and Development from the Federal Institute - Campus Farroupilha. At the moment, I feel like I've learned a significant portion of web concepts, so I've started to explore embedded systems. My studies include electrical concepts, electricity, electronic components, microcontrollers, and low-level code (C, C++).</p>
    <p>My goal is to one day contribute to the open-source community in the development of brain-machine interface systems. <span class="emoji">üñ•Ô∏è</span> <span class="emoji">üß†</span> <span class="emoji">ü¶æ</span></p>

        <p>I live in Brazil and have over 5 years of experience as a software developer. At the moment, I feel that I have mastered a significant portion of web concepts, and I am currently learning to develop embedded systems. Because of this, I am studying electrical concepts, electricity, and electronic components.</p>

        <p>My goal is to one day contribute to the open-source community in the development of brain-machine interface systems.  üñ•Ô∏è üß† ü¶æ</p>

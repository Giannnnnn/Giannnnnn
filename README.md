Giovani Florek - Software Developer
I live in Brazil and have over 5 years of experience as a software developer. At the moment, I feel that I have mastered a significant portion of web concepts, and I am currently learning to develop embedded systems. Because of this, I am studying electrical concepts, electricity, and electronic components.
My goal is to one day contribute to the open-source community in the development of brain-machine interface systems.  🖥️ 🧠 🦾

Giovani Florek - Software Developer
I live in Brazil and have over 5 years of experience as a software developer. At the moment, I feel that I have learned a significant portion of web concepts, and now Im currently starting to learn about embedded systems, studying electrical concepts, electricity, and electronic components.
My goal is to one day contribute to the open-source community in the development of brain-machine interface systems.  🖥️ 🧠 🦾
